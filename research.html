    <h2> Research Interests </h2>
    <p>
        I am broadly interested in applications
        of topological string theories to complex differential and algebraic
        geometry. 
        <br>
        My Ph. D. thesis was under the supervision of David Morrison, and is
        titled ``Supersymmetric Topological Sigma Models and Doubling Spaces''.
        The thesis is available in the open access repository eScholarship, and
        can be found 
        <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8tz617wq">here</a>.
    </p>

        My research is focused on <em> topological
        string theories with extended supersymmetry</em>,
        specifically the N=4 supersymmetric topological string theory proposed by
        Berkovits and Vafa. These theories naturally exist on manifolds with a
        hyperk&auml;hler structure, and encode invariants of the manifold such 
        as Dolbeault cohomology groups with respect to the various complex structures.
        It is known that certain sectors of this theory compute the derived
        category of coherent sheaves on the manifold with respect to a chosen
        complex structure, and I am working on finding relations between these
        different sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also working on incorporating the framework of <em> generalized
        complex geometry </em> into the N=4 model. Recently, computational
        tools for generalized complex geometry have been developed that allow
        for certain abstract quantities (e.g. cohomology of an exact Courant
        agebroid) to be computed in terms of more familiar quanities on a closely
        related geometric space. I am working on applying these tools in the 
        hyperk&auml;hler setting to compute the various relevant categories
        in the N=4 model.
    </p>

        My thesis explored these topics in the context of abelian varieties.
        We show that a doubling construction, in the sense of Hull and Reid-Edwards'
        Double Field Theory, is a natural setting to study B-type D-branes on
        the abelian variety from a Lagrangian perspective. We establish that
        line bundles (rank-one space-filling D-branes) lift to linear Lagrangian
        torii in the doubled space, and the intersection theory of these
        torii is closely related to the topological open-string spectrum
        of the original theory.

            fascinating symmetry this surface enjoys.
